==========

Version 1.0.(1) *(2017-Aug-03)*
----------------------------

 * Only `VideoImage` view has to be completely visible to start auto-play instead of the whole RecyclerView item.
 * Get callbacks when video is started or paused by overriding `videoStarted()` and `pauseVideo()` methods of `CustomViewHolder`.
 * Set looping property of videos by using `holder.setLooping(true);`.
 * If RecyclerView is loaded Asynchronously, call `recyclerView.playAvailableVideos(0)` to start autoplay video once item is loaded.
 * Does not need smoothScrollBy hack anymore to init videos before scrolling.
